A simple Ruby/GTK app to help Japanese language learners with Hiragana and Katakana.
It introduces users to the sounds of the kana and teaches basic recognition of both writing systems.

## Installation

The easiest method is to install the snap. However, Kita is also available as a Ruby Gem.

In order to install the gem version on Ubuntu, first install Ruby and the following libraries:

`sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential`

Now installation should be as simple as:

`sudo gem install kita`

You can now run `kita`
